### Cooldown Time

The cooldown time to operating temperature for MUSCAT is approximately 80
hours from the point at which the pulse tube cooler is turned on. In the plot
shown above the oscillations in the 4-K and 450-mK plates seen after 60
hours is due to the recycling of the continuous sorption coolers for the 1-K
and 450-mK stages. The 450-mK stage temperature sensor has an upper limit on
its calibration of approximately 250&nbsp;K which leads to the static reading
seen before 10 hours.
