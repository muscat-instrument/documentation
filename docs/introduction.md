## What this site provides

Here we aim to provide information useful to those working with and on the MUSCAT instrument as operators along with descriptions of the performance of MUSCAT as measured during lab verification and engineering runs. We describe the various control systems and hardware components of MUSCAT and what influence these have on the raw data and science products from MUSCAT.

## What this site does not provide

This site does not and will not provide real-time telemetry from or interfacing to the MUSCAT control systems. Nor is any form of scheduling information given. It does not provide details or instructions for non-standard maintenance or work on the instrument.
