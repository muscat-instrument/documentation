## Installing the 450-mK Shield

:::info
This step requires at least three people. Two to lift and locate the shield and one to secure the initial bolts.
:::

1. With the 450-mK shield below MUSCAT approximately orientate the shield so the coloured alignment marks on the top rim of the shield and the edge of the 450-mK plate. Using two people.
2. Using two people, lift the shield into place. It will need to be tilted to clear the internal components at the 450-mK stage. Extreme care should be taken not to damage the tubes of the miniature dilution refrigerator, these contain the He4/He3 mix and are at high pressure (70 Bar, 1000 PSI).
3. Place the bolts (with washers) to secure the 450-mK shield to the plate. These bolts are places through the 450-mK plate and screw into the 450-mK shield.
4. Plug in the 450-mK lid RTD at the interface between the shield and the plate, there is an orientation marker on each part of the connector.

## Installing the 4-Kelvin Shield

1. Place the 4-Kelvin shield on appropriate lifting equipment orientated .
2. Using the lifting equipment, raise the 4-Kelvin shield around the 450-mK shield taking care not to catch or damage the 450-mK shield.
3. At the two positions marked with an asterisk (`*`), place bolts through the 4-Kelvin plate and tighten them into the pre-installed nuts in the 4-Kelvin can.
4. In the remaining bolt holes, locate the bolts through the 4-Kelvin shield and screw them into the tapped holes in the plate.
5. Plug in the 4-Kelvin lid diode sensor at the interface between the shield and the lid, there is an orientation marking in each part of the connector.
