Prior to being shipped from Cardiff, a number of shipping braces were installed within MUSCAT to help protect the weak mechanical supports from damage during shipping. Prior to use, these will need to be carefully removed and some components reinstalled within MUSCAT.

:::tip
Fixings and other parts that need installing after the braces have been removed are contained in a cardboard box (Shipping List number #1-2), which is strapped to the side of MUSCAT.
:::

## 50 K Stage braces

The braces support the bottom end of the 50 K shield adding radial struts which brace the shield to the inside of the vacuum shield. The braces brace against the inner lining of the vacuum shield and a foam padding block is placed between the lining and the inner wall of the vacuum can.

### Brace 30

**Prior To Removal**: Note the position of the alignment marks on the bottom plate of the vacuum shield to help when reinstalling the plate. With MUSCAT on the working frame, slowly vent the vacuum via the side port, the ingression of air to the cryostat should be as slow as possible and only just audible. With the bottom plate of the cryostat fully supported, remove and store the bolts securing this plate to the cryostat. Slowly lower the plate away from the main body of the cryostat ensuring the O-ring remains within the groove in the plate.

:::warning
Take care to protect O-ring and vacuum surfaces while removing bottom plate. 
:::

**To Remove**: Loosen 2 x M4 bolts and slide brace towards the centre of the cryostat, away from the inner wall of the 4 K can. Remove black foam shipping padding, marked with red tape, located between OVC inner wall and lining. Remove 2 x M4 bolts fully and remove brace. Take care not to damage lining when removing brace.

Tighten opposite bolts sequentially to ensure even compression of O-ring and level installation of plate.

:::warning
When reinstalling bottom OVC plate, make sure O-ring, O-ring grove and mating surface are all clean. Make sure O-ring is located in grove correctly prior to reinstalling plate and that the O-ring does not move during mounting of the plate.
