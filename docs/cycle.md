Of the three sub-Kelvin stages in MUSCAT two—the 1-K and 450-mK stages—are cooled by continuous sorption coolers. In total there are six sorption pumps used to cool these stages with two He4 pumps used to cool the 1-K stage and two sets of He4-He3 paired pumps to cool the 450-mK stage. For each stage, the pumps are divided into two subsystems (refereed to as A and B)
