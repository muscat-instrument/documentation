To open the MUSCAT cryostat it should be first mounted on the work frame with the _clam plate_ closed and secured in place, this allows the vacuum can and radiation shields to be lowered.

:::caution
Before opening the cryostat, the operator should be certain that all the stages and internal components of MUSCAT have thermalised to room temperature.

## Mounting MUSCAT on the Work Frame

1. With MUSCAT placed centrally under the work frame, remove the bolts on the long edge of each clam plate and loosen the bolts in the slots on the short edges.
2. Slowly slide the clam plates outwards in small alternation steps as to avoid the work frame tipping.
3. By rotating the gear-shaped dial on each wheel of the work frame, raise the rubber foot allowing the wheel to move freely on the floor.
4. Raise the MUSCAT cryostat through the opening between the two clam plates and move the work frame to ensure the cryostat is centred with respect to the work frame.
5. Slide the clam plates closed in small steps and alternating plates to ensure the work frame does not tip. Move the frame as needed to ensure the MUSCAT cryostat is centred.
6. Tighten the bolts in the short edges of the clam plates and reinstall and tighten the bolts in the long edges.
7. Rotate the work frame to align the outer-most bolt holes in the top plate of MUSCAT with the corresponding holes in the clam plates.
8. Lower the MUSCAT cryostat so the top plate is resting on the clam plates.
9. Instal and tighten bolts through the outer-most holes in the top plate of the MUSCAT cryostat to secure the cryostat to the work frame.
10. Rotate the gear-shaped dial on each wheel to lower the rubber foot and raise the wheel slightly off the floor.
